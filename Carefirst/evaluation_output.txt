Do I need to possess an Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP) card in order to receive service from the Carefirst Family Health Team?

Patients with an OHIP card are welcome to enroll with one of our physicians, subject to their availability. We strongly advise prospective new patients to make an advance booking before coming to our clinic. New patients without a booking will be seen only if the physician is available at the time of the visits.

Patients without an OHIP card (non-OHIP service)

Patients without an OHIP card but are in dire need of medical care can make an appointment with one of our physicians, subject to their availability. A non-OHIP service fee will apply.

What about healthcare for refugees?

Refugees’ health care needs may be covered by the Interim Federal Health Program (IFHP). Please call in advance of your visit and specify your status. Please bring your identity document when you come.

What services are not covered by OHIP?

OHIP covers a wide range of health services. A brief description of insured services is available from

http://www.health.gov.on.ca/en/public/programs/ohip/ohipfaq_mn.aspx

OHIP does not cover:

treatment that is medically unnecessary

health services that are rendered at a facility that is not a licensed hospital or licensed health facility

treatment that is generally accepted by the medical profession in Ontario, as being experimental, or for research or for part of a study

treatment rendered for an illness, disease condition or injury that arose inside Canada

ambulance services or transportation costs

other services specifically set out in the regulations as uninsured or otherwise not listed as insured.

Examples of uninsured services are sick notes, massage letters, physiotherapist notes, travel immunization, copy and transfer of medical records. We charge patients a fee for providing uninsured services.
