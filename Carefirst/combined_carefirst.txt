Service Description: A non-profit, volunteer-based organization dedicated to meeting the needs of children by fostering self-worth, positive growth and a sense of belonging. It promotes and monitors long term supportive friendships between children and caring adults.

IN-SCHOOL MENTORING - A Mentee is a child between the ages of 6 and 12, who, with the parent and school's approval, is matched with an adult mentor. The Mentor and the child meet for one hour per week at the child's school during school hours. The goal of the friendship is to assist the child in boosting their self-esteem and confidence. The Mentor and Mentee may spend their time together doing such activities as: playing board games, cooking, crafts, reading, computers or physical activity. As with the traditional programs, volunteers must go through a screening process prior to matching.

TRADITIONAL MATCHES - BIG BROTHER, BIG SISTER MATCHES - A Little Brother or Sister is a child between the ages of 6 and 16, from primarily a single-parent family who, with the parent's approval, has requested a friendship with a Big Brother or Big Sister. An extensive screening process is initiated by the agency to ensure that the Little's needs, as well as the Big's and Parent's expectations, are fully explored and taken into consideration prior to a "match" being made.
Fees: No fees

SERVICE QUESTIONS
What is a Family Health Team?
A Family Health Team is an approach to primary health care that brings together different health care providers to co-ordinate the highest possible quality of care for you – the patient. Designed to give doctors support from other complementary professionals, most Family Health Teams will consist of doctors, nurses, nurse practitioners and other health care professionals who work collaboratively, each utilizing their experience and skills so that you receive the very best care, when you need it, as close as possible.
Is Carefirst Family Health Team a walk in clinic?
No, the Carefirst Family Health Team is not a walk-in clinic. It operates a regular doctor’s clinic, which means to see one of our doctors, you must be registered as a patient and book an appointment in advance.
What is the advantage of a Family Health Team?
The Family Health Team is able to provide primary care with not only a general practitioner, but by bringing together a dedicated team of specialists and other health professionals in order to best serve your needs. With several practitioners in one convenient location, you, as a patient, will not have to worry about external referrals and transfers.
What is the Carefirst Family Health Team’s Clinic Hours
Our clinic opens from 9 am to 8 pm from Monday to Thursday, from 9 am to 6 pm on Friday, and from 9 am to 2 pm on Saturday. Please check with the medical secretary for your family doctor’s clinic hours.
Can I receive medical advice after the Carefirst Family Health Team’s Clinic Hours?
During the clinic’s closure hours, if you have a medical emergency, please go to the nearest hospital’s emergency department or dial 911 for assistance. If it is a non-medical emergency, you can call the telephone help advisory service (THAS) at 1-866-553-7205 for consultation.
What are the languages spoken by the Carefirst Family Health Team physicians?
Our physicians speak English, Cantonese, Mandarin and Tamil.
ELIGIBILITY QUESTIONS
Do I need to possess an Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP) card in order to receive service from the Carefirst Family Health Team?
Patients with an OHIP card are welcome to enroll with one of our physicians, subject to their availability. We strongly advise prospective new patients to make an advance booking before coming to our clinic. New patients without a booking will be seen only if the physician is available at the time of the visits.
Patients without an OHIP card (non-OHIP service)
Patients without an OHIP card but are in dire need of medical care can make an appointment with one of our physicians, subject to their availability. A non-OHIP service fee will apply.
What about healthcare for refugees?
Refugees’ health care needs may be covered by the Interim Federal Health Program (IFHP). Please call in advance of your visit and specify your status. Please bring your identity document when you come.
What services are not covered by OHIP?
OHIP covers a wide range of health services. A brief description of insured services is available from
http://www.health.gov.on.ca/en/public/programs/ohip/ohipfaq_mn.aspx
OHIP does not cover:
treatment that is medically unnecessary
health services that are rendered at a facility that is not a licensed hospital or licensed health facility
treatment that is generally accepted by the medical profession in Ontario, as being experimental, or for research or for part of a study
treatment rendered for an illness, disease condition or injury that arose inside Canada
ambulance services or transportation costs
other services specifically set out in the regulations as uninsured or otherwise not listed as insured.
Examples of uninsured services are sick notes, massage letters, physiotherapist notes, travel immunization, copy and transfer of medical records. We charge patients a fee for providing uninsured services.

Frequently Asked Questions
Service Questions
Eligibility Questions
SERVICE QUESTIONS
What is a Family Health Team?
A Family Health Team is an approach to primary health care that brings together different health care providers to co-ordinate the highest possible quality of care for you – the patient. Designed to give doctors support from other complementary professionals, most Family Health Teams will consist of doctors, nurses, nurse practitioners and other health care professionals who work collaboratively, each utilizing their experience and skills so that you receive the very best care, when you need it, as close as possible.
Is Carefirst Family Health Team a walk in clinic?
No, the Carefirst Family Health Team is not a walk-in clinic. It operates a regular doctor’s clinic, which means to see one of our doctors, you must be registered as a patient and book an appointment in advance.
What is the advantage of a Family Health Team?
The Family Health Team is able to provide primary care with not only a general practitioner, but by bringing together a dedicated team of specialists and other health professionals in order to best serve your needs. With several practitioners in one convenient location, you, as a patient, will not have to worry about external referrals and transfers.
What is the Carefirst Family Health Team’s Clinic Hours
Our clinic opens from 9 am to 8 pm from Monday to Thursday, from 9 am to 6 pm on Friday, and from 9 am to 2 pm on Saturday. Please check with the medical secretary for your family doctor’s clinic hours.
Can I receive medical advice after the Carefirst Family Health Team’s Clinic Hours?
During the clinic’s closure hours, if you have a medical emergency, please go to the nearest hospital’s emergency department or dial 911 for assistance. If it is a non-medical emergency, you can call the telephone help advisory service (THAS) at 1-866-553-7205 for consultation.
What are the languages spoken by the Carefirst Family Health Team physicians?
Our physicians speak English, Cantonese, Mandarin and Tamil.
ELIGIBILITY QUESTIONS
Do I need to possess an Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP) card in order to receive service from the Carefirst Family Health Team?
Patients with an OHIP card are welcome to enroll with one of our physicians, subject to their availability. We strongly advise prospective new patients to make an advance booking before coming to our clinic. New patients without a booking will be seen only if the physician is available at the time of the visits.
Patients without an OHIP card (non-OHIP service)
Patients without an OHIP card but are in dire need of medical care can make an appointment with one of our physicians, subject to their availability. A non-OHIP service fee will apply.
What about healthcare for refugees?
Refugees’ health care needs may be covered by the Interim Federal Health Program (IFHP). Please call in advance of your visit and specify your status. Please bring your identity document when you come.
What services are not covered by OHIP?
OHIP covers a wide range of health services. A brief description of insured services is available from
http://www.health.gov.on.ca/en/public/programs/ohip/ohipfaq_mn.aspx
OHIP does not cover:
treatment that is medically unnecessary
health services that are rendered at a facility that is not a licensed hospital or licensed health facility
treatment that is generally accepted by the medical profession in Ontario, as being experimental, or for research or for part of a study
treatment rendered for an illness, disease condition or injury that arose inside Canada
ambulance services or transportation costs
other services specifically set out in the regulations as uninsured or otherwise not listed as insured.
Examples of uninsured services are sick notes, massage letters, physiotherapist notes, travel immunization, copy and transfer of medical records. We charge patients a fee for providing uninsured services.

Integrated Dialysis Care
Integrated Dialysis Care (IDC) Program
Carefirst Seniors and Community Services Association is pleased to announce that we are expanding our existing partnership with the Scarborough and Rouge Hospital on another innovative initiative – the Integrated Dialysis Care Program for assisted Peritoneal Dialysis (aPD) patients. The IDC Program is one of the only six programs chosen by Ontario Renal Network (ORN) to support the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care’s transformational goals to address gaps in home and community care for patients on peritoneal dialysis.
The IDC will promote a more effective funding structure, resulting in seamless, consistent, and accessible dialysis care for patients in their homes and community.  Scarborough and Rouge Hospital and Carefirst will expand their partnership that Carefirst is contracted directly to enter both patient homes and long-term care homes to provide for the aPD patients.
The IDC program will seek to reduce the reliance on in-hospital based care and advance home dialysis in order to provide patients with better care closer to home. The IDC program will have dedicated health care providers specifically trained in peritoneal dialysis and will match resources based on the unique needs of the patient. Patients in the program will also be given the opportunity to participate in Carefirst’s range of support services including our Adult Day Program and Wellness Programs. The IDC program will enable seamless, timely, and highly quality care at home and in the community essential to building a patient-centred renal care system.
